## dellhw_exporter - Author

Prometheus exporter for Dell Hardware components using the Dell OMSA.

The exporter was originally made by PrFalken. Due to some issues in the code, I rewrote the whole exporter using the "node_exporter" pattern and therefore moved it from being a fork out, to a standalone repository.

## Past

#### Cloudical - DevOps Engineer

I have worked at Cloudical Deutschland GmbH for over 3 years. In that time I have worked at several customer projects, ranging from the automotive industry to finance and startups.
I helped Cloudical's customer succeed in their adventures into container technologies and the problems that can arise from these technologies.

#### 1&1 Mail & Media Development & Technology GmbH - Junior System Administrator

I have mainly worked on development and administration of Kubernetes clusters for applications.
Besides containers, we have maintained automation services, such as GitLab, GoCD, Puppet, Vault, etc.
To keep the infrastructure we provide monitored we used Golang, to develop Prometheus exporters, e.g., [https://github.com/galexrt/dellhw_exporter/](https://github.com/galexrt/dellhw_exporter/).
