From the feedback I got on Twitter I did a good job.

I finally got to meet Hans Cornelis which I owed me a beer for some help with Rook :-P

### Extra

Bringing home some of that delicious Belgian berr is a must :-)

## Monday

Shout out to my Uber driver "Aziz" for knowing all the shortcuts through the city so I was on time.

It was cool to see former colleagues and many friends there. Always nice to have a chat about life and current projects.

Have Fun!
