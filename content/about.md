Hello, I'm Alexander aka galexrt.

I was the Founding Engineer of [Koor Technologies, Inc.](https://koor.tech/).
I am specialized in containerization, Kubernetes and storage using Rook and Ceph.

In my spare time, I am a system administrator and developer with a passion for gaming, self hosting and, most importantly open source.
I'm also working on the German [Modern Gaming](https://modern-gaming.net/) Multi-Gaming community, with over 10k members, as an infrastructure administrator.
