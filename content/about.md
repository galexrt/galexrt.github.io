Hello, I'm Alexander Trost aka galexrt.

I'm working at [Koor Technologies, Inc.](https://koor.tech/) as a Founding Engineer. I am specialized in the areas of containers, Kubernetes and Rook.
I'm a sysadmin who uses containers, storage, automation, self-hosting, scripting, coding in Go, playing with new technologies and games.

In addition to that in my free time I'm maintaining and administrating the infrastructure of the German Garry's Mod community [Modern Gaming](https://modern-gaming.net/).

If you want to contact me, you can use the social media links at the bottom of the left sidebar, or use good old [email](mailto:me@galexrt.moe) to reach me.
