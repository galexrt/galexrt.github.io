## Recommended Adapter

I can recommend the "SONOFF Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle Plus" adatapr (ASIN: `B09KXTCMSC`).

You can buy it from several vendors, e.g., [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KXTCMSC).

**Warning**: Make sure that you get the SONOFF dongle with `` chips and not `EFR32MG21 + CH9102F`.

The `CC2652P + CP2102N` has [firmwares available](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/) from [Koenkk](https://github.com/Koenkk) that work very well.
::

Make sure to flash it with the latest firmware after receiving just to make sure that the firmware is really the latest.
