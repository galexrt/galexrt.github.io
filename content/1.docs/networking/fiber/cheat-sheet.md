## RJ45 (Copper) T-Base SFP/ SFP+

As long as they support one of the T-Base standards (e.g., 1000T-Base), they should be able to be used like a "normal RJ45 ethernet network" port.

**Info**: T-Base standard
For the SFP/ SFP+ to work with, e.g, 10/ 100/ 1000, each of the nT-Base standards must be "implemented" in them.

## Simplex and Multimode fiber cables and transceivers

You should **not** mix simplex with multimode fibers and transceivers, and the other way around.

## "You'll never have a second go for APC connectors"

Due to the polishing (angle 8Â°) of APC fiber "ends", if you plugin the fiber connector the wrong way, you'll "break" them (slight crunch noise).
E.g., plugging SC APC connectors in the wrong way.

**Make sure to check the orientation markers and with that always plug APC connectors in the correct way!**

UPC connectors are having no polish at all so no need to worry about the way to plug them in.
