## OS1 and OS2

**Mode**: Singlemode.

Bi-Directional, only one line/ cable core needed.

"Only one side can sent at once", used for longer distances.

TODO

## OM1/ OM2/ OM3/ OM4/ OM5

**Mode**: Multimode.

"Two lines/ cable cores each for 'one way' of data", used for "short" distances.

## Simplex vs Duplex fiber

* Simplex cable are consisting of a single cable strand.
* Duplex cable are consisting of two cable strands ("glued" together).

## Singlemode vs Multimode

* Singlemode only allows one light mode to pass through at a time.
    * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-mode_optical_fiber)
    * Advantages:
        * Much further distances (e.g., OS2 up to 10 kilometers for 10G).
        * Good for WAN network "applications".
    * Disadvantages:
        * Higher cost (depending on where you buy, up to 6-times more expensive).
* Multimode have shorter reach though are because of their price better suited, for, e.g., in datacenter usage.
    * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mode_optical_fiber)
    * Advantages:
        * Lower cost (in comparison with Singlemode).
        * Compatible with many different data protocols, e.g., ethernet.
    * Disadvantages:
        * Nowhere near the distance of Singlemode (e.g., OM4 10G distance is "only" up to 550 meters).
